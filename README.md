# Tile-Manipulation-W-Modularity
HTML, CSS and JavaScript Tile Manipulation with canvas

The "Tile" application is intended to choose the base color for the generation of the four cohesions (shades of that base color) of a square module, and the modularity of the respective tile, through the following interactive handling devices:

a) A color input device for choosing the base color, the initial color being pure orange ("#ff8000");
b) A cursor to monitor the choice of modularity values, in the integer scale between 1 and 40, the initial value being 12;
